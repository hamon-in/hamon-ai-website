# Initializing Transmission
First dispatch from the Hamon network. On building AI agents that actually think, reason, and act autonomously.

The age of passive AI tools is over. What comes next are systems that don't just respond — they *initiate*. Agents that observe, plan, and execute multi-step workflows without hand-holding.

We've been building these systems for a while now. Not chatbots. Not copilots. Fully autonomous agents deployed inside real businesses, handling real operations — from data pipeline orchestration to customer interaction flows.

## What makes an agent different?

A tool waits for input. An agent has *intent*. It maintains context across interactions, breaks complex goals into sub-tasks, uses tools dynamically, and self-corrects when things go wrong.

The technical stack matters less than the architecture:
- **Memory**: Long-term and working memory that persists across sessions
- **Planning**: Ability to decompose goals into executable steps
- **Tool use**: Dynamic selection and invocation of APIs, databases, and services
- **Reflection**: Self-evaluation loops that catch errors before they propagate

## Why now?

Foundation models have crossed a capability threshold. With the right scaffolding — retrieval systems, execution environments, feedback loops — you can build agents that handle 80% of knowledge work autonomously.

The remaining 20% is where humans add irreplaceable value: judgment, creativity, and ethical oversight.

We're not replacing people. We're removing the bottleneck between *knowing what to do* and *getting it done*.
